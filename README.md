By Thu Pham Dieu Anh, Jinke Lyu, and Maria R. Lily Djami.

This is the repository for the project in computer vision lecture at the Goethe University Frankfurt, winter term 2021/22.

The topic of this project is to recreate the results of the paper 
[Xiao, T., Dollar, P., Singh, M., Mintun, E., Darrell, T., and Girshick, R. (2021). *Early convolutions help transformers see better*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14881)

For this project we used two implementations for the model presented in the paper: one in [PyTorch by Jack Etheredge](https://github.com/Jack-Etheredge/early_convolutions_vit_pytorch), and one in Tensorflow based on the [ViT implementation by Khalid Salama](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/)

The implementations are in the pytorch and tensorflow folders accordingly, and our experiments were conducted using Jupyter notebooks which are located in the experiments folder.

Some experiments were conducted using Kaggle.
